# es-theme-nostalgic

"Nostalgic" theme for Retropie EmulationStation by SuperMagicom.

I have always admired the "Nostalgia" platform videos made by Viking for Launchbox and wished they could be used on Retropie.  Since EmulationStation does not support platform videos, I decided to try creating a theme using static images of them.

All credit for the visual aesthetic goes to Viking. My contribution is the code to display the images as an ES theme and align the video snaps for each system individually. It was a lot of work but I am pleased with the results and I hope you will be too!

## Installation

Install from the Retopie setup menu or by copying the unarchived "nostalgic" folder and all of the contents to

```
/opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/themes
```

If this folder does not exist you may create it.

IMPORTANT: I recommend keeping EmulationStation's VRAM setting at 80. This theme uses 1080p images for each system and the WSOD (White Screen of Death) fix seems to only work correctly when VRAM is at 80.
